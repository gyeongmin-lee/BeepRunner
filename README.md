## Get Started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Testing

BeepRunner includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

For detailed testing information, see [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md).

## Development

This project follows test-driven development practices. All features must include corresponding tests and pass quality gates before completion.

- **Code Quality**: ESLint with Expo configuration
- **Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage**: 80%+ overall, 90%+ for business logic
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in CLAUDE.md and PRD.md

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:
