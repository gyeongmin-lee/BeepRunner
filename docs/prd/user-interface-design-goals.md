# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

BeepRunner delivers a focused fitness application prioritizing clarity and usability during intense physical activity. The interface emphasizes large, easily readable text and intuitive controls accessible even when users are fatigued. Visual design follows modern flat design principles with mode-specific color coding (blue for Personal, green for Standard) ensuring users always understand their current context.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **One-handed operation**: All critical controls accessible with thumb while holding device
- **Visual hierarchy**: Timer displays use 56px fonts, level indicators 32px, ensuring visibility during exercise
- **Immediate feedback**: Every user action provides instant visual and audio confirmation
- **Mode differentiation**: Consistent color coding and iconography prevents user confusion between workout types
- **Progressive disclosure**: Complex features hidden behind simple initial choices

## Core Screens and Views

- **Home Screen**: Mode selection with feature descriptions and quick access to history/settings
- **Calibration Flow**: Step-by-step space measurement with real-time timer and confirmation
- **Workout Timer**: Full-screen timer with pause/resume controls and progress indicators
- **Completion Summary**: Results display with feedback options and next action suggestions
- **Workout History**: Calendar view with progress charts and personal best tracking
- **Settings**: Language, theme, audio preferences, and calibration management

- Minimum 44pt touch targets for all interactive elements
- High contrast text ratios for visibility during exercise
- Screen reader compatibility for timer and progress announcements
- Alternative text for all iconography

## Branding

BeepRunner employs a modern, fitness-focused visual identity:
- **Color palette**: Muted blue (#6B8FB5) for Personal mode, muted green (#7BA05B) for Standard mode
- **Typography**: Clean, highly legible fonts with strategic weight distribution (medium 500 default, semibold 600 for critical timers)
- **Iconography**: Material Design icons ensuring cross-platform consistency
- **Motion**: Subtle animations providing feedback without distraction during workouts

## Target Device and Platforms

- **Primary**: iOS and Android smartphones in portrait orientation
- **Secondary**: Tablet support with responsive layouts
- **Tertiary**: Web browser access for testing and development
- **Optimization**: 5.5" to 6.7" screen sizes representing 90% of target market
