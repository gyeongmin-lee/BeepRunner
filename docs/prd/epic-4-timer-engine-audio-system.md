# Epic 4: Timer Engine & Audio System ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE - Robust timing engine with cross-platform audio

Develop precise timer engine with audio feedback system supporting both workout modes with accurate timing and comprehensive audio cues.

## Story 4.1: Core Timer Engine ✅

As a **developer**,
I want **reliable timer infrastructure supporting both workout modes**,
so that **all timing operations maintain accuracy and consistency**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 4.1.1: ✅ useTimer custom hook with unified timer logic for both modes
- 4.1.2: ✅ Accurate interval timing with ±50ms tolerance maintained
- 4.1.3: ✅ Pause/resume functionality preserving elapsed time calculations
- 4.1.4: ✅ Level progression logic handling automatic advancement
- 4.1.5: ✅ Timer state management with proper cleanup and error handling

## Story 4.2: Audio System Integration ✅

As a **user**,
I want **audio cues during workouts**,
so that **I can focus on exercise without constantly watching the screen**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 4.2.1: ✅ AudioProvider context with expo-audio integration
- 4.2.2: ✅ Beep sounds for workout intervals using MP3 audio files
- 4.2.3: ✅ Countdown audio cues (3-2-1-GO) for calibration measurement
- 4.2.4: ✅ Level change announcements with distinct audio feedback
- 4.2.5: ✅ Silent failure handling when audio files unavailable

## Story 4.3: Component Architecture Refactoring ✅

As a **developer**,
I want **modular timer components with reusable patterns**,
so that **code maintainability improves and testing becomes easier**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 4.3.1: ✅ Six reusable timer components extracted (ScreenHeader, LevelIndicator, CountdownDisplay, ProgressBar, TimerControls, WorkoutSummary)
- 4.3.2: ✅ Personal timer code reduced from 1232 to 783 lines (-36%)
- 4.3.3: ✅ Standard timer code reduced from 587 to 159 lines (-73%)
- 4.3.4: ✅ useCalibration hook for Personal mode specific logic
- 4.3.5: ✅ Consistent styling and mode-aware theming across components
