# Epic 5: Testing Infrastructure ✅

**Status**: COMPLETE - Comprehensive testing framework operational

Establish robust testing infrastructure ensuring code quality, preventing regressions, and enabling confident feature development.

## Story 5.1: Testing Framework Setup ✅

As a **developer**,
I want **comprehensive testing infrastructure**,
so that **code quality remains high and regressions are prevented**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 5.1.1: ✅ Jest configuration with jest-expo preset for Expo compatibility
- 5.1.2: ✅ React Native Testing Library integration for component testing
- 5.1.3: ✅ Test scripts for watch mode, coverage reporting, and category execution
- 5.1.4: ✅ Coverage reporting with HTML and LCOV output formats
- 5.1.5: ✅ Test organization with unit/components/integration/e2e structure

## Story 5.2: Business Logic Test Coverage ✅

As a **developer**,
I want **critical business logic thoroughly tested**,
so that **core functionality reliability is guaranteed**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 5.2.1: ✅ BeepTestConfig functions tested with 100% coverage (17 tests)
- 5.2.2: ✅ DatabaseService operations tested with 88% coverage (15 tests)
- 5.2.3: ✅ Timer hooks tested with 95% coverage including state management
- 5.2.4: ✅ Calibration calculations tested with edge cases and boundary conditions
- 5.2.5: ✅ Total test suite: 86 passing tests with <8 second execution time

## Story 5.3: Testing Utilities and Mocks ✅

As a **developer**,
I want **comprehensive mocking strategy and test utilities**,
so that **tests are reliable, fast, and independent of external dependencies**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 5.3.1: ✅ Database mocking with in-memory SQLite simulation
- 5.3.2: ✅ Audio system mocking with silent operation fallbacks
- 5.3.3: ✅ Timer mocking using Jest fake timers for deterministic testing
- 5.3.4: ✅ Custom render utilities for component testing with providers
- 5.3.5: ✅ Test data factories for consistent test setup

## Story 5.4: Quality Gates and CI Integration ✅

As a **development team**,
I want **mandatory quality gates preventing broken code deployment**,
so that **production releases maintain high reliability standards**.

### Acceptance Criteria

- 5.4.1: ✅ Test failure prevents feature completion per development workflow
- 5.4.2: ✅ Coverage requirements: 80% overall, 90% business logic
- 5.4.3: ✅ Performance requirements: full test suite completes under 30 seconds
- 5.4.4: ✅ Documentation updated with testing strategy and best practices
- 5.4.5: ✅ Quality gates enforced in CLAUDE.md development workflow
