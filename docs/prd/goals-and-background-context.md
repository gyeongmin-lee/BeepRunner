# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to perform shuttle run fitness tests in any space size through intelligent calibration
- Provide accurate standard 20m beep test implementation for official fitness assessments
- Deliver comprehensive workout tracking and progress analysis capabilities
- Establish a robust testing infrastructure ensuring app reliability and maintainability
- Create an intuitive cross-platform mobile experience supporting both iOS and Android

## Background Context

BeepRunner addresses a critical gap in fitness testing applications by solving the space constraint problem that renders traditional 20m shuttle run tests inaccessible to many users. Currently available solutions (primarily YouTube videos) are inflexible, offering only fixed 20m distances with no customization options.

Our innovative approach combines standard regulation testing with intelligent space calibration, enabling users to perform effective shuttle run training in apartments, small gyms, military facilities, or any available space. The app has successfully delivered a complete MVP with all core functionality implemented, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and a foundation ready for advanced features.
