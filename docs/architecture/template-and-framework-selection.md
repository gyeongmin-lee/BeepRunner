# Template and Framework Selection

BeepRunner is built using **React Native Expo** managed workflow, providing a unified development experience across iOS, Android, and web platforms. The project utilizes Expo SDK 53+ with the latest React Native capabilities while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

## Framework Rationale

**Expo React Native** was selected for:
- **Cross-platform deployment**: Single codebase supporting iOS, Android, and web
- **Managed workflow**: Streamlined development without native code complexity
- **Rich ecosystem**: Built-in modules for audio, database, navigation, and device APIs
- **Testing integration**: Excellent Jest and React Native Testing Library support
- **Rapid prototyping**: Hot reloading and expo-dev-client for fast iteration
