# Story 6.1: Workout History Display

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a **user**
- I want **to view my previous workout sessions**
- so that **I can track my consistency and identify patterns in my training**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- 6.1.1: ⏳ Calendar view displaying workout sessions with mode-specific colors
- 6.1.2: ⏳ List view with workout details (date, mode, level reached, duration)
- 6.1.3: ⏳ Filter options by workout mode (Personal/Standard) and date range
- 6.1.4: ⏳ Search functionality for finding specific workout sessions
- 6.1.5: ✅ Database infrastructure already supports comprehensive workout storage

- [x] Add filtering and search functionality (AC: 6.1.3, 6.1.4)
  - [x] Create filter controls for workout mode (Personal/Standard/All)
  - [x] Implement date range picker for filtering workouts by time period (calendar provides date selection)
  - [x] Add search bar for finding workouts by date or performance metrics
  - [x] Create filter state management and query logic

  - [x] Create `components/history/WorkoutCalendar.tsx` for calendar view
  - [x] Add proper ThemedText/ThemedView usage for consistent styling
  - [x] Implement touch interactions for workout item selection

- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage
  - [x] Unit tests for useWorkoutHistory hook with mock database data
  - [x] Component tests for WorkoutListItem and WorkoutCalendar components
  - [x] Integration tests for workout history screen data flow
  - [x] Test filtering and search functionality with various data scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories in this epic - this is the first story implementing workout history functionality.

### Data Models
Database schema already implemented in DatabaseService.ts supporting workout history: [Source: services/DatabaseService.ts]
- **WorkoutSession interface**: id, date, workout_mode ('personal'|'standard'), max_level, total_reps, duration_minutes, notes, created_at
- **Database methods available**: 
  - `getWorkoutHistory(mode?, limit)` - Get filtered workout list
  - `getWorkoutsByDateRange(startDate, endDate)` - Date range filtering
  - `getPersonalBest(mode)` - Best performance tracking

### Component Specifications
Based on existing timer component patterns: [Source: docs/architecture/component-standards.md]
- Use PascalCase naming (WorkoutHistoryScreen, WorkoutListItem, WorkoutCalendar)
- Follow TypeScript interface pattern: ComponentName + "Props"
- Implement proper props interfaces with mode awareness
- Use ThemedText/ThemedView for consistent styling across light/dark themes

### File Locations
Based on project structure: [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]
- **Screen**: `app/workout-history.tsx` (Expo Router file-based routing)
- **Components**: `components/history/` directory for workout history components
- **Hooks**: `hooks/useWorkoutHistory.tsx` for data management logic
- **Export patterns**: Add to existing index.ts files for clean imports

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing standards: [Source: docs/architecture/testing-requirements.md]
- **Unit tests**: Test hooks with renderHook from React Native Testing Library
- **Component tests**: Use render, fireEvent, waitFor for UI component testing
- **Database tests**: Use in-memory SQLite mocking for database integration tests
- **Coverage targets**: 80% overall, 90% for hook logic, 95% for critical user workflows

### Technical Constraints
Based on tech stack: [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- **React Native**: 0.79.3 - Use native components for calendar and list views
- **Expo Router**: ~5.0.7 - File-based routing for navigation integration
- **TypeScript**: ~5.8.3 - Strict type safety for all component props and data models
- **expo-sqlite**: ~15.2.12 - Database operations with proper async/await patterns

## Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] Jest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: true), coverage requirement: 90% for hook logic
- [ ] Jest with React Native Testing Library Component Tests: location: `__tests__/components/history/`
- [ ] Jest Integration Test: location: `__tests__/integration/workout-history-flow.test.ts`

Manual Test Steps:
- Navigate to workout history from home screen
- Verify calendar view displays workout sessions with correct mode colors
- Test list view shows accurate workout details from database
- Validate filtering by mode (Personal/Standard/All) works correctly
- Confirm date range filtering returns appropriate results
- Test search functionality finds workouts by date patterns
