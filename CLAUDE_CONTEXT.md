# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md

This file tracks the current development status and context for Claude Code sessions.

## Recent Changes

### 2025-06-07
- **CLAUDE.md created**: Initial documentation file with project overview and development commands
- **CLAUDE.md updated**: Enhanced with detailed business logic, calibration algorithms, database schema, and design guidelines based on PRD.md
- **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md created**: This context tracking file initialized
- **CLAUDE.md workflow section added**: Added development workflow protocol requiring PRD.md reference and CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md updates for all development tasks
- **Core MVP implementation completed**: Home screen mode selection, timer screens with Material Icons, standard beep test logic with level progression
- **UI/UX fixes applied**: Fixed scrolling issues, header truncation, timer text sizing, and button text visibility across all screens
- **Critical layout fixes**: Resolved bottom scroll truncation (added 120px bottom padding) and top timer truncation (removed minHeight conflicts, added proper margins)

## Current Tasks

### In Progress
- No active development tasks currently in progress

### Pending (Ready to Start)
- Audio system implementation with expo-av synthesized beeps (P0 - MVP)
- Personal mode calibration flow implementation (P0 - MVP)
- Timer completion feedback and workout summary screens (P0 - MVP)

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD.md with full feature specifications
- ✅ Set up CLAUDE.md with architecture and development guidelines
- ✅ Initialized CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md for session tracking
- ✅ Established development workflow protocol in CLAUDE.md requiring PRD.md reference and context updates

### Project Setup
- ✅ Initial Expo React Native project structure created
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- ✅ Expo Router with file-based routing configured
- ✅ Theme system with light/dark mode support established

### Core Application Features (Phase 1 - Week 1)
- ✅ BeepTestConfig.ts with standard level configurations and calibration logic
- ✅ Home screen with mode selection UI using Material Icons
- ✅ Navigation structure for Standard and Personal timer screens
- ✅ Standard timer screen with level progression logic
- ✅ Personal timer screen with calibration workflow structure
- ✅ Core standard beep test timer with automatic level/rep advancement
- ✅ UI/UX fixes: Safe area handling, scrollable content, proper text sizing, responsive layouts

## Known Issues

### None Currently Identified
- No technical blockers or critical issues at this time

### Potential Risks (from PRD)
- **High Priority**: Background audio policies on iOS/Android may change
- **High Priority**: User calibration accuracy dependency in Personal mode
- **Medium Priority**: User adoption challenges vs existing YouTube solutions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Remaining Phase 1 - Week 1)
1. **Implement audio system**: Set up expo-av with synthesized beep generation for timer events
2. **Complete personal calibration**: Implement countdown, measurement, and confirmation flow
3. **Add workout completion**: Post-workout feedback screens and difficulty adjustment
4. **Test basic functionality**: Ensure navigation, timer logic, and user flows work properly

### Short Term (Phase 1 - Week 2-3)
1. **Database integration**: SQLite setup for workout history and calibration storage
2. **Background operation**: Timer continues when app is backgrounded
3. **Enhanced audio**: Real audio files for beeps and voice announcements
4. **Progress tracking**: Workout history and statistics screens

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- All required dependencies already in package.json (expo-av, expo-sqlite, react-native-chart-kit)
- PRD.md contains detailed acceptance criteria for all features
- CLAUDE.md provides technical implementation guidelines
