# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md

This file tracks the current development status and context for Claude Code sessions.

## Recent Changes

### 2025-06-07
- **CLAUDE.md created**: Initial documentation file with project overview and development commands
- **CLAUDE.md updated**: Enhanced with detailed business logic, calibration algorithms, database schema, and design guidelines based on PRD.md
- **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md created**: This context tracking file initialized
- **CLAUDE.md workflow section added**: Added development workflow protocol requiring PRD.md reference and CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md updates for all development tasks
- **Core MVP implementation completed**: Home screen mode selection, timer screens with Material Icons, standard beep test logic with level progression
- **UI/UX fixes applied**: Fixed scrolling issues, header truncation, timer text sizing, and button text visibility across all screens
- **Critical layout fixes**: Resolved bottom scroll truncation (added 120px bottom padding) and top timer truncation (removed minHeight conflicts, added proper margins)
- **Documentation updates**: Added Epic 5 for multi-language and theme switching features to PRD.md and CLAUDE.md

## Current Tasks

### In Progress
- No active development tasks currently in progress

### Pending (Ready to Start)
- Audio system implementation with expo-av synthesized beeps (P0 - MVP)
- Personal mode calibration flow implementation (P0 - MVP)
- Timer completion feedback and workout summary screens (P0 - MVP)
- Settings screen with multi-language support (P1 - Post-MVP)
- Theme switching functionality (dark/light mode) (P1 - Post-MVP)

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD.md with full feature specifications
- ✅ Set up CLAUDE.md with architecture and development guidelines
- ✅ Initialized CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md for session tracking
- ✅ Established development workflow protocol in CLAUDE.md requiring PRD.md reference and context updates
- ✅ Added Epic 5 specifications for multi-language (Korean/English) and theme switching (dark/light mode) features

### Project Setup
- ✅ Initial Expo React Native project structure created
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- ✅ Expo Router with file-based routing configured
- ✅ Theme system with light/dark mode support established

### Core Application Features (Phase 1 - Week 1)
- ✅ BeepTestConfig.ts with standard level configurations and calibration logic
- ✅ Home screen with mode selection UI using Material Icons
- ✅ Navigation structure for Standard and Personal timer screens
- ✅ Standard timer screen with level progression logic
- ✅ Personal timer screen with calibration workflow structure
- ✅ Core standard beep test timer with automatic level/rep advancement
- ✅ UI/UX fixes: Safe area handling, scrollable content, proper text sizing, responsive layouts

## Known Issues

### None Currently Identified
- No technical blockers or critical issues at this time

### Potential Risks (from PRD)
- **High Priority**: Background audio policies on iOS/Android may change
- **High Priority**: User calibration accuracy dependency in Personal mode
- **Medium Priority**: User adoption challenges vs existing YouTube solutions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Remaining Phase 1 - Week 1)
1. **Implement audio system**: Set up expo-av with synthesized beep generation for timer events
2. **Complete personal calibration**: Implement countdown, measurement, and confirmation flow
3. **Add workout completion**: Post-workout feedback screens and difficulty adjustment
4. **Test basic functionality**: Ensure navigation, timer logic, and user flows work properly

### Short Term (Phase 1 - Week 2-3)
1. **Database integration**: SQLite setup for workout history and calibration storage
2. **Background operation**: Timer continues when app is backgrounded
3. **Enhanced audio**: Real audio files for beeps and voice announcements
4. **Progress tracking**: Workout history and statistics screens

### Medium Term (Phase 2 - Post-MVP)
1. **Settings screen implementation**: Create settings UI with proper navigation
2. **Multi-language support**: Implement i18next with Korean/English translations
3. **Theme switching**: Add dark/light mode with system preference detection
4. **Settings persistence**: AsyncStorage integration for user preferences

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- All required dependencies already in package.json (expo-av, expo-sqlite, react-native-chart-kit)
- New dependencies needed for Epic 5: expo-localization, i18next, react-i18next, @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- PRD.md contains detailed acceptance criteria for all features including Epic 5 (multi-language and theme switching)
- CLAUDE.md provides technical implementation guidelines including theme and i18n system specifications
