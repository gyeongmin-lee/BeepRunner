# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md

This file tracks the current development status and context for Claude Code sessions.

## Recent Changes

### 2025-06-07
- **CLAUDE.md created**: Initial documentation file with project overview and development commands
- **CLAUDE.md updated**: Enhanced with detailed business logic, calibration algorithms, database schema, and design guidelines based on PRD.md
- **CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md created**: This context tracking file initialized
- **CLAUDE.md workflow section added**: Added development workflow protocol requiring PRD.md reference and CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md updates for all development tasks

## Current Tasks

### In Progress
- No active development tasks currently in progress

### Pending (Ready to Start)
- Epic 0: Home screen and mode selection implementation (P0 - MVP)
- Epic 1: Standard Beep Test implementation (P0 - MVP) 
- Epic 2: Personal Beep Test with calibration (P0 - MVP)
- Epic 3: Core shuttle timer engine (P0 - MVP)

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive PRD.md with full feature specifications
- ✅ Set up CLAUDE.md with architecture and development guidelines
- ✅ Initialized CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md for session tracking
- ✅ Established development workflow protocol in CLAUDE.md requiring PRD.md reference and context updates

### Project Setup
- ✅ Initial Expo React Native project structure created
- ✅ TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- ✅ Expo Router with file-based routing configured
- ✅ Theme system with light/dark mode support established

## Known Issues

### None Currently Identified
- No technical blockers or critical issues at this time

### Potential Risks (from PRD)
- **High Priority**: Background audio policies on iOS/Android may change
- **High Priority**: User calibration accuracy dependency in Personal mode
- **Medium Priority**: User adoption challenges vs existing YouTube solutions

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 - Week 1)
1. **Remove starter code**: Run `npm run reset-project` to clear example content
2. **Implement core timer logic**: Create shuttle run timer engine with standard level configurations
3. **Build home screen**: Implement mode selection UI (Standard vs Personal Beep Test)
4. **Set up audio system**: Configure expo-av with mock audio files for beeps and voice announcements
5. **Implement Standard mode**: Basic 20m fixed-distance beep test functionality

### Short Term (Phase 1 - Week 2-3)
1. **Personal mode calibration**: Time-based space measurement with countdown UX
2. **Adaptive feedback system**: Post-workout difficulty adjustment mechanism
3. **Database integration**: SQLite setup for workout history and calibration storage
4. **Background operation**: Timer continues when app is backgrounded

### Dependencies & Prerequisites
- All required dependencies already in package.json (expo-av, expo-sqlite, react-native-chart-kit)
- PRD.md contains detailed acceptance criteria for all features
- CLAUDE.md provides technical implementation guidelines
