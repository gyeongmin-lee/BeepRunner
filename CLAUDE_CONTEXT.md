# CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md

This file tracks the current development status and context for Claude Code sessions.

## Recent Changes

### 2025-06-10
- **üîß Development Reset Button Added**: Implemented temporary reset data button for development testing
- **Reset functionality**: Added "Reset All Data (Dev)" button to home screen Quick Actions section
- **Confirmation dialog**: Implemented safety confirmation before clearing data to prevent accidental resets
- **Visual distinction**: Styled with red color, dashed border, and clear "Dev" label to indicate temporary nature
- **Database integration**: Connected to existing `clearAllData()` method that preserves app settings
- **Loading state**: Added disabled state with "Resetting..." text during operation
- **üêõ Calibration Calculation Fixed**: Corrected inverted distance calculation formula
- **Issue**: Distance calculation was inverted (e.g., 4.5s ‚Üí 40m instead of 10m)
- **Root cause**: Formula was using `(STANDARD_TIME / measuredTime)` instead of `(measuredTime / STANDARD_TIME)`
- **Fix applied**: Changed to correct formula: `estimatedDistance = (measuredTime / STANDARD_TIME) * STANDARD_DISTANCE`
- **Verified**: All test cases now calculate correctly (4.5s ‚Üí 10m, 9s ‚Üí 20m, 18s ‚Üí 40m)
