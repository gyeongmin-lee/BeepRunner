## Recent Changes

### 2025-06-13
- **‚ú® Personal Timer Feedback Feature Completed**: Implemented fully functional difficulty feedback system
- **Feedback buttons connected**: All three feedback options (Too Easy/Perfect/Too Hard) now save to database

- **UI unchanged**: Development experience remains the same, production users see cleaner interface
- **üöÄ Stop‚ÜíFinish Button Replacement**: Replaced destructive "Stop" with positive "Finish" action
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Added Alert confirmations before finishing workouts to prevent accidents
- **Green finish buttons**: Changed to positive green color (#4CAF50) to indicate constructive action
- **Workout data preservation**: Finish button saves partial workouts instead of discarding progress
- **Standard Timer completion screen**: Added step-based navigation with workout summary display
- **Consistent UX**: Both Personal and Standard timers now have positive finish workflows

### 2025-06-10
- **üéµ MP3 Audio Implementation**: Replaced programmatic beep generation with actual MP3 audio files
- **Audio file integration**: Updated AudioProvider to use rep_beep.mp3 and level_beep.mp3 from assets/audio/
- **Error handling**: Added silent failure handling - if MP3 files don't load, audio functions return without error
- **Code cleanup**: Removed WAV generation code for rep and level beeps while keeping it for other sounds
- **Type safety**: Updated AudioProvider with proper null checks and optional chaining for MP3 players
- **üîß Development Reset Button Added**: Implemented temporary reset data button for development testing

- **üêõ Calibration Calculation Fixed**: Corrected inverted distance calculation formula
- **Issue**: Distance calculation was inverted (e.g., 4.5s ‚Üí 40m instead of 10m)
- **Root cause**: Formula was using `(STANDARD_TIME / measuredTime)` instead of `(measuredTime / STANDARD_TIME)`
- **Fix applied**: Changed to correct formula: `estimatedDistance = (measuredTime / STANDARD_TIME) * STANDARD_DISTANCE`
- **Verified**: All test cases now calculate correctly (4.5s ‚Üí 10m, 9s ‚Üí 20m, 18s ‚Üí 40m)

## Known Issues

### Finish Button Not Working Properly
- When "Finish" is pressed and confirmation dialog is shown, the timer should be paused.

### Pause Button Not Working Properly
- When paused and resumed, it does not resume at the paused time, but the timer resets.

### Standard Timer Feedback Screen Duration
- The "Duration" in the standard time feedback screen should be displayed in this format: `X min Y sec)
- The duration should be calculated by multiplying the number of reps in each level with the level's time, and combine all the calculated levels.

### Last Calibration Not Updating
- "Last Calibration" data does not reflect the updated standard that's been reflected from user's feedback on feedback screen

### Potential Risks (from PRD)
- **High Priority**: Background audio policies on iOS/Android may change
- **High Priority**: User calibration accuracy dependency in Personal mode
- **Medium Priority**: User adoption challenges vs existing YouTube solutions
